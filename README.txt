Python code to obtain bitcoin price and volome data from MtGox.com

The _bitCoinTicker class retrieves ticker data (json format) from mtgox.com and converts
it to plain html. The resulting ticker is similar to the one displayed on the Mt. Gox
main page.

This script can run as a server-side include (cgi) in your web page.

Requires Python 2.6 or above.  I have tested it with Python 2.7.3.
